# Connection Manager

This is a api to handle connection with databases and servers, so if you have many databases that you need to control or server that you need to store the connection information the ideia is to segregate by group and maybe create a frontend in the future.

This project is a side project for my portfolio, but the idea comes from a real problem that I face on may daily work.

## Swagger

This api have a Swagger implementation on endpoint /apidocs and the ideia is to run on a container.

### Pending activities

There are many thing that still need fixing but I'm creating the README.md to track the ideas that rise on the process.

* TODO:
  * Finish the swagger documentation for all routes
  * Finish the Resources for all Models
  * Improve the access control
  * Implement the function control by group
